Count Positive Integers Ignoring None
Given a list which contains integers and None, count the number of positive integers while ignoring None values. Zero should not be counted.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

For the list [1, -2, 3, 0, None, 4], the result should be 3 because the positive integers are 1, 3, and 4.

Explanation

    • We ignore None values.

    • We also ignore 0 because it is not positive.

    • The positive integers are 1, 3, and 4, so the count is 3.
